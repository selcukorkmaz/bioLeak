Description: Tools to prevent and detect information leakage in biomedical machine learning.
 Provides leakage-resistant split policies (subject-grouped, batch-blocked, study leave-out, time-ordered),
 guarded preprocessing (train-only imputation, normalization, filtering, feature selection),
 cross-validated fitting with common learners, permutation-gap auditing, batch/fold association tests,
 duplicate detection, and a one-click HTML audit report. Accepts SummarizedExperiment or plain matrices.
