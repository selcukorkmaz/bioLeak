Description: Prevents and detects information leakage in biomedical machine learning.
  Provides leakage-resistant split policies (subject-grouped, batch-blocked, study leave-out, time-ordered),
  guarded preprocessing (train-only imputation, normalization, filtering, feature selection),
  cross-validated fitting with common learners, permutation-gap auditing, batch and fold association tests,
  and duplicate detection.
