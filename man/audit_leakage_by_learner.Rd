\title{Audit leakage per learner}
\usage{
audit_leakage_by_learner(
  fit,
  metric = c("auc", "pr_auc", "rmse", "cindex"),
  learners = NULL,
  parallel_learners = FALSE,
  mc.cores = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{LeakFit}

\item{metric}{performance metric ("auc","pr_auc","rmse","cindex")}

\item{learners}{optional character vector of learner names to audit; defaults
to all learners found in predictions.}

\item{parallel_learners}{logical, if TRUE run audits per learner in parallel
using \code{future.apply}.}

\item{mc.cores}{integer, number of workers for learner-level parallelism.}
}
\value{
Named list of LeakAudit objects.
}
\description{
Runs [audit_leakage()] separately for each learner recorded in the fit and
returns a named list of `LeakAudit` objects.
