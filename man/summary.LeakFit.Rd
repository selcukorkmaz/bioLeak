\title{Summarize a LeakFit object}
\usage{
\method{summary}{LeakFit}(object, digits = 3, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A [LeakFit] object returned by [fit_resample()]. It should
contain `metric_summary` and `audit` slots; missing entries result in empty
sections in the printed report.}

\item{digits}{Integer scalar. Number of decimal places to print in numeric
summary tables. Defaults to 3; affects printed output only, not the
returned data.}

\item{...}{Unused. Included for S3 method compatibility; changing these
values has no effect.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns `object@metric_summary`, a data frame of per-learner
  metric means and standard deviations computed across folds. This function
  does not recompute metrics.
}
\description{
Prints a compact console report for a [LeakFit] object created by
[fit_resample()]. The report lists task/outcome metadata, learners,
total folds, and cross-validated metrics summarized as mean and standard
deviation across completed folds, plus a small audit table with per-fold
train/test sizes and retained feature counts.
}
\details{
This summary is meant for quick sanity checks of the resampling setup and
performance. It does not run leakage diagnostics and will not detect target
leakage, duplicate samples, or batch/study confounding; use [audit_leakage()]
or `summary()` on a [LeakAudit] object for those checks.
